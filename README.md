# Decomposing-matrices-as-a-sum-of-two-tripotents-over-prime-fields
This idea came to my mind when I was working on my research project "When is a matrix a sum of involutions or tripotents?". Theoretically, we have shown that for an integer n >=1, every matrix in a n by n matrix ring over a field is a sum of two tripotents if and only if this field is isomorphic to the prime field $F_p$, where p = 2, 3, or 5. 

It would be very helpful if I could get the two tripotents for a decomposed matrix. Therefore, I tried to write this little project after learned some basic knowledge of python. It will take quite a long time to run if you want to use it for large order n and large prime p.
